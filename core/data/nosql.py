# Users should extend nosql.py to create "NoSQL models". The models will be responsible for providing the 
# custom fields, while nosql.py will be responsible for providing the interface to actually interact with the
# selected nosql db
# 
# This file should provide:
# key/value adapter
# document adapter
# graph adapter
# column adapter
